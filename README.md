# Soliman-Academy
This is a one-page responsive website built using HTML &amp; CSS as part of my learning journey. It represents an equestrian academy with a focus on clean design, responsiveness across devices, and attention to detail in layout and styling. The project demonstrates my understanding of HTML5 and CSS3 while exploring best practices for web development.
